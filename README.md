# Psychic Game #

Can you guess what letter the computer is thinking? Test your abilities with this simple game. :crystal_ball::computer:

## What this project does ## 

This simple project makes uses of simple `variables` to contain scores and game data, `if-else statements` to validate wins, losses, and user guesses, as well as an `onkeyup function` to collect dynamic user input.

## How users can get started with this project ## 

### How to Play: ###

1. **[Start the game](https://fkakatie.github.io/psychic-game/)**.
    - Beneath the page header and above the footer, there are two boxes: a container for wrong guesses and another for game stats.

2. **Guess what letter the computer is thinking**.
    - Type any letter to make your guess. Only unique letters in the English alphabet are accepted; any other key (including duplicates) will throw an error alert &mdash; but will not count against you as another guess.  

3. **Win or lose**.
    - If you successfully guess what letter the computer is thinking, you'll be notified with an alert and earn a win.
    - If you cannot guess what the computer is thinking within ten guesses, you'll be notified with an alert and incur a loss.

4. **Play again**!
    - After either a win or a loss, your previous guesses will be cleared and the computer will guess another letter, allowing you to keep playing as long as you'd like.
